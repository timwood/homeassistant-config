# Groups

## Camera
Groups all IP cameras and switches for camera flash into a visible tab in HA interface.

## Default
Will eventually be used to clean up default view

## Lights
Single word light groups for working integration with Google Home > ifttt > maker channel voice commands (which isn't smart enough to translate 'living room' to entity_id living_room in the API call).
Hidden groupings for individual, per room and per level with a visible 'Lights' tab, for all lights, in HA interface. 

## People
'Weasley Clock' for tracking family members by device.

## Weather
Hidden weather sensors grouped and then displayed in a visible 'Weather' tab with local radar image in HA interface.
